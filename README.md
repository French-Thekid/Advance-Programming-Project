This application enables farmers to create account and sign in to advertise and sell their product, they can add images of
their product as well as view other farmers selling the same product to get that competitive edge.
customers can also create accounts and view all the products on the "market" as well as the farmer selling and product details.
we allowed customers to search fpr specific farmers should they wish to then they can add item to their shopping cart, which
ofcourse can be removed at any time, as well as change the quantity of an item base on it availability. with real time total
price being displated after each action.In order to check out the customer need to ensure there is enough cash in their 
respective account, if not they can select profile and add money to their account which will be deducted everytime a purchase

should a farmer's crop run low in quantity he can simply add more of that crop. which will be available to customers. 
should a customer have a crop in their basket and someone purchase the same crop before they check out, leading to the crop 
in their basket becomming unavailable, they will be notified at checkout.
